# Abused Wiki

Git Repository I abuse as knowledge base. Similar to a collection of "Awesome Lists" but because the term "Awesome" seems a bit abused so an additional reason to call it "Abused" ;)

## Security List

- [Abused Security](./abused-security.md) - my personal security link collection
- [Awesome Threat Intelligence](https://github.com/hslatman/awesome-threat-intelligence) - Threat intelligence collection provided by @hslatman
- [Fishy Processes](fishy-processes.md) - List of processes that seem fishy but aren't...

## Keep It Simple Lists

- [What to log](./what-to-log.md) - A list on what stuff to log to detect attacks but reduce the noise as much as possible
